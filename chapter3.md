#Chapter 3 Storage and Retrieval
---
* Introduce a very simple database using shell command. Insert is O(1), read is O(n)
* Introduce Index here. This is an important trade-off in storage systems: well-chosen indexes speed up read queries, but every index slows down writes. 
* Hash Indexes. Put the index in memory. Merge it later for different segments.
