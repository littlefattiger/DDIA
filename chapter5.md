# Chapter 5 Replication
---
This chapter mainly talk about different type of replications.
* Purpose:
  * High availability
  * Disconnected operation
  * Latency
  * Scalability 
* Leaders and Followers
* Single-leader replication
* Multi-Leader Replication
* leaderless model
* The general idea is about reduce latency, data outdated.
* eventually consistent?
* Whether one operation happens before another operation is the key to defining what concurrency means. 
* multiple writes -> like github version control to control concurrency
