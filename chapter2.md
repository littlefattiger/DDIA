# Chapter 2
---
In this chapter we will look at a range of general-purpose data models for data storage and querying. In particular, we will compare the relational model, the document model, and a few graph-based data models.

1. RMDB VS NoSQl
2. Using RMDB database, document database(like MongoDB)/ NOSQL. Use Linkedin profile as an example here.
  * The main arguments in favor of the document data model are schema flexibility, bet‚Äê ter performance due to locality, and that for some applications it is closer to the data structures used by the application. The relational model counters by providing better support for joins, and many-to-one and many-to-many relationships.
