# Chapter 2
---
In this chapter we will look at a range of general-purpose data models for data storage and querying. In particular, we will compare the relational model, the document model, and a few graph-based data models.

* RMDB VS NoSQl
* Using RMDB database, document database(like MongoDB)/ NOSQL. Use Linkedin profile as an example here.
  * RMDB and documnet model, which one to use? Here it talk about the benefit and drawback of different models. The choice of model depends on datas.
  * Schema-on-read is similar to dynamic (runtime) type checking in programming languages, whereas schema-on-write is similar to static (compile-time) type checking.
  * many-to-many relationship is resolve a little bit on RMDB
* SQL is declaired and some other language is imperative(指令式的）, like IMS and CODASYL. 
* We can have RMDB, document and also can haev graph model. -> Example Cypher for graph to do query.
* Data model -> decided by applicants. How to use data, how complicated the query is, SQL 4 lines VS Graph Queries 29 lines
* property graph model, Triple-Stores and SPARQL

## Actually, this chapter give us an overview of data modeling, including RMDB, Document model, and graph model, triple stpre model. Some are pretty old, I think it is only serve as an introduction for this chapter. He also mention query language for different model here.
